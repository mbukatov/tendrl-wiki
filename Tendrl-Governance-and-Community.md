* "**Reviewers**": reviewers are per component, all PRs on said component need sign-off from reviewers if not signed-off by "Tendrl core".
   * Reviewers:
       * [Julien lim](https://github.com/julienlim) (For Components: Tendrl/ui, SDS metrics/monitoring dashboard and Alerting, Tendrl/specifications)

* Decisions on Tendrl Architecture, road-map, code reviews, Tendrl project operations (CI, planning) require sign-off from the Tendrl core team.
* Core team domains: project vision, architecture, roadmap, framework and component design, project-wide technical documentation, Management of code, Tendrl commons framework, operations eg: code reviews, code documentation, Automated testing, Tendrl CI
* Core team responsibilities are based on their domains and are flexible.
* The core team members are the primary authority of their respective domains. However, any project wide decisions need to be agreed upon by majority of the core members.
* The core team has the authority over delegation of the component ownership.
* Component owners are responsible for merging code on the respective component git repos.

## Code of conduct:
* The core team would ensure that their decisions are transparent and announced on the project’s mailing list.
* The core team would ensure that discussions, diverse opinions and contributions are encouraged, heard, evaluated and valid ones acted upon.
* The core team would ensure that the decisions made regarding the project and changes to the road-map would align with the project vision.
