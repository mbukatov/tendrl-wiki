## Governance structure:
* "**Tendrl core**" - The Tendrl core team consists of ([Mrugesh Karnik](https://github.com/brainfunked), [Rohan Kanade](https://github.com/r0h4n), [Nishant Thomas](https://github.com/nthomas-redhat)).
* "**Reviewers**": reviewers are per component, all PRs on said component need sign-off from reviewers if not signed-off by "Tendrl core".
   * Reviewers:
       * [Ju lim](https://github.com/julienlim) (For Components: dashboard, SDS metrics/monitoring dashboard and Alerting)
       * [Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay](https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay) (For Components: documentation)

* Tendrl core team manages the Tendrl GitHub organisation (includes management of contributors, component maintainers, org admins, CI)
* Decisions on Tendrl Architecture, road-map, code reviews, Tendrl project operations (CI, planning) require sign-off from the Tendrl core team.
* Core team domains:
   * [Mrugesh Karnik](https://github.com/brainfunked): project vision, architecture, roadmap, framework and component design, project-wide technical documentation
   * [Rohan Kanade](https://github.com/r0h4n): Management of code, Tendrl framework, operations eg: code reviews, documentation.
   * [Nishant Thomas](https://github.com/nthomas-redhat): Management of code, Automated testing, documentation, code reviews, Tendrl CI
* Core team responsibilities are based on their domains and are flexible.
* The core team members are the primary authority of their respective domains. However, any project wide decisions need to be agreed upon by all of the core members.
* The core team has the authority over delegation of the component ownership.
* Component owners are responsible for merging code on the respective component git repos.

## Code of conduct:
* The core team would ensure that their decisions are transparent and announced on the projectâ€™s mailing list.
* The core team would ensure that discussions, diverse opinions and contributions are encouraged, heard, evaluated and valid ones acted upon.
* The core team would ensure that the decisions made regarding the project and changes to the road-map would align with the project vision.
