Pre-requisites for Creating Ceph cluster via tendrl-api

- Configure appropriate ceph repositories on all cluster nodes as required by ceph-installer
- Disable gpg key check for ceph repositories on all cluster nodes

Pre-requisites for Creating and Importing Gluster cluster via tendrl-api
- On any **one** node in the gluster cluster, Append the tag "provisioner/gluster" to "tags" list in /etc/tendrl/node-agent/node-agent.conf.yaml 
- This "provisioner/gluster" node will be selected to install Gdeploy and python-gdeploy by Tendrl

Additional pre-requisites for Importing existing Gluster cluster via tendrl-api
- All nodes in existing Gluster cluster should be peer probed already (for ImportCluster), only after which tendrl-node-agent should be installed on all nodes, without peer probe, the node wont be detected by tendrl as a gluster node.
