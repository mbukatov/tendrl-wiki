This is overview of pending work related to SSL configuration for Tendrl.

## What are the use cases?

* Secure all direct user facing interfaces of Tendrl server machine (tendrl web, grafana web).
* Secure all remaining services running on Tendrl server machine (etcd, carbon, ...).
* Secure all communication channels within storage cluster (etcd, carbon, ...).

By **secure** we mean both:

* TLS based encryption (aka SSL) of the communication channel
* authentication of all encrypted channels (there is no point in encrypting communication channel when one can open one for themselves without authentication)

Ports opened on Tendrl server:

* 2379/tcp etcd (could be encrypted and authenticated via ssl, which is documented)
* 2003/tcp carbon
* 10080/tcp graphite
* 9292/tcp puma (tendrl-api)
* ~3000/tcp~ Grafana dashboard used to be available there
* 8789/tcp webhook receiver
* 80/tcp (apache web server, hosting Tendrl web, API and Grafana dashboard)

## Recent or Planned features related to SSL Configuration

### Make grafana available via http instead of using dedicated port 3000/tcp

* https://github.com/Tendrl/ui/pull/1074
* https://github.com/Tendrl/api/pull/447
* https://github.com/Tendrl/monitoring-integration/pull/578
* https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-ansible/issues/127

## What needs to be done

* [ ] figure out which components need to use SSL:
   - web browser -> tendrl (served via httpd)
   - web browser -> grafana (served via httpd)
   - web browser -> graphite:
      - [ ] do we want to have graphite web available?
      - [ ] if yes, we need to proxy it through httpd as well
   - various tendrl components -> graphite
   - various tendrl components -> etcd (TLS client-server based authentication)
      - [x] already documented
      - [x] partially implemented via tendrl-ansible (when users generate TLS CA files themselves)
      - [ ] deployment of default Tendrl CA for TLS client-server based authentication
* [ ] implement tendrl - grafana authentication
* [ ] additional code changes may be needed (excluding tendrl-ansible), eg: some hardcoded http urls
* [ ] how to configure it (initial dev docs)
* [ ] how to implement default via tendrl-ansible
* [ ] document when default CA deployment provided by tendrl-ansible is a good idea
