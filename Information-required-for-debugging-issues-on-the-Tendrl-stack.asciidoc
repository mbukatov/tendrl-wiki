In the short-to-medium term we'll be adding a log collector script/utility which can be run on each node of the cluster and package the logs in a structured pay-load. This document intends to build up the set of data points which will be addressed by the script/utility.

# Specific to issues (failure/errors/incomplete) observed during import

## General information

IMPORTANT: This information is required for each of the cluster nodes.

* output of `ps aufx`
* output of `netstat -ntlp`
* output of `rpm -qa | grep tendrl`
* the contents of the `/etc/hosts` file
* output of `hostname`
* output of `ip addr ls`

Additionally, the output of the following from the python 2.7.x console:

  import socket
  socket.getfqdn()
  socket.gethostname()
  socket.gethostbyaddr([ip]) # where [ip] is the IP address, run this once for each IP of the system


## Gluster specific issues

IMPORTANT: This information is required from each of the cluster nodes, in addition to the general information specified above.

If the import issues are observed on a Gluster cluster, we need:

* Output of `gluster peer list`
