When import fails, right now we 2 options:

1.  unmanage, resolve the issue, import again
1.  resolve the issue, unmanage, import again
1.  resolve the issue, import again
1.  import again

The questions here are:

 * should we recommend option #1 over #2 or vice versa and why?
 * is it ok to run import after import without unmanage and should tendrl allow it?
 * could either option #3 or #4 break tendrl so that unmanage would not work?
